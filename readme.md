# HideImages

Hide sexually explicit, bothersome, or any other images you want from Spotify using this Spicetify extension.


## Usage

Open the context menu at tracks, albums or artists and click on the menu item to throw them to the trashbin and never see their images again.

What works:  
Almost everything except these features which are not implemented yet: 

- filtering of Discography pages, 
- filtering of the Home page, 
- filtering of Playlists (the icon of the playlist on the playlist's page and the playlist icons on artist overview pages).
