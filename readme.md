# HideImages

Hide sexually explicit, bothersome, or any other images you want from Spotify using this Spicetify extension.


## Usage:

Open the context menu at tracks, albums or artists and click on the menu item to throw them to the trashbin and never see their images again.

What works:  
Almost everything except these features which are not implemented yet: 

- filtering of Discography pages, 
- filtering of the Home page, 
- filtering of Playlists (the icon of the playlist on the playlist's page and the playlist icons on artist overview pages). 

## Known bugs:

- Right clicking and blocking a song will add the song to the trashbin while it's supposed to add the album to the trashbin. It will display the message "Song added to trashbin". Pressing the trash _icon_ (next to the song's name) works correctly, however.
